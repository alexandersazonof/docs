title: 分散型ネットワークへのサブグラフの公開
---

Once your subgraph has been [deployed to Subgraph Studio](/deploying/deploying-a-subgraph-to-studio), you have tested it out, and are ready to put it into production, you can then publish it to the decentralized network.

サブグラフを分散型ネットワークに公開すると、[キュレーター](/network/curating)がキュレーションを開始したり、[インデクサー](/network/indexing)がインデックスを作成したりできるようになります。

対応ネットワークの一覧は[こちら](/developing/supported-networks)で確認できます。

## サブグラフの公開

Subgraphs can be published to the decentralized network directly from Subgraph Studio dashboard by clicking on the **Publish** button. Once a subgraph is published, it will be available to view in [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer/).

- Subgraphs can be published to Arbitrum One. [Learn more about The Graph Network on Arbitrum](/arbitrum/arbitrum-faq).

- サブグラフが公開されたネットワークに関係なく、[サポートされているネットワーク](/developing/supported-networks)のデータをインデックス化できます。

- 既存のサブグラフの新バージョンを公開する場合は、上記と同じルールが適用されます。

## Adding signal to your subgraph

Developers can add GRT signal to their subgraphs. If a subgraph is eligible for indexing rewards, Indexers who provide a "proof of indexing" will receive a GRT reward, based on the amount of GRT signalled. You can check indexing reward eligibility based on subgraph feature usage [here](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer/blob/main/docs/feature-support-matrix.md). Specifically supported networks can be checked [here](/developing/supported-networks).

> Adding signal to a subgraph which is not eligible for rewards will not attract additional Indexers.

> If your subgraph is eligible for rewards, is recommended that you curate your own subgraph with at least 3,000 GRT (as of April 11th, 2024) in order to attract additional indexers to index your subgraph

Subgraph Studio enables you to to add signal to your subgraph by adding GRT to your subgraph's curation pool in the same transaction it is published.

Alternatively, you can add GRT signal to a published subgraph from Graph Explorer.

## パブリッシュされたサブグラフのメタデータの更新

Once your subgraph has been published to the decentralized network, you can modify the metadata at any time by making the update in Subgraph Studio dashboard of the subgraph. After saving the changes and publishing your updates to the network, they will be reflected in Graph Explorer. This won’t create a new version, as your deployment hasn’t changed.
